            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage</h1>
            <p>Context </p>
                <p>The assignment was with a partner to make up a fake movie. Or based off an existing movie A website describing the movie scenario,adding images, colors, adding a fake link with a submit button, with options to press. Which could have been based on options or choices about the movie.  </p>
            <p>  Content </p>
                <p>   I made a movie webpage about a horror movie of a man moving into a New town getting a new job in a new neighborhood. His neighbor was always  really nice to him. When we got a job working at an insurance office with his neighbor who followed him home one day disappeared right in front of him. Re appeared in his attic then killed him.It's a horror based color scheme with red, Maroon and black as the main colors with creative commas (local images) Of horror clowns being sourced.</p>
          <p> Challenge
            <p> One thing  I found a challenge was when I went to add a submit button It was not in its own block. It was in the same block as the id selector buttons. I solved this by realizing that I needed to add a closing label tag after I typed the world submit. Then have a separate label tag for the selector buttons. So the submit button would have its own label block. 
                <p>Another challenge When making this project was adding non copyright images. I went back to the slides and figured out that I had to make sure it wasn't copyright by pressing creative commas. </p> 
            <p>The biggest challenge in this project was that my partner didn't keep up with our in class html and css lessons. So they didn't know how to code anything. They also didn't dedicate the time to learn html or css. So I had to complete the whole project on my own.</p>  
          
           <p> Some takeaways </p>
           <p>#1 Always double check if you have an opening tag that your closing tag has a bracket otherwise the code won't work properly.</p> 
            <p> #2 IF I am unclear about a project's specific requirements or back to that project's slides. It will most likely have an image showing what to do.</p> 
            <p>#3 I will always make sure to stay caught up to date with the code you are learning in class, through looking back at slides and FCC lessons. Because when a project comes along and you don't know how to do the code, leaving your partner to do all the work is unfair. As well if you both don't stay caught up to date with the code then you both will be lost and fail the project.</p>
